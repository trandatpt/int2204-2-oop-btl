# Arkanoid: Global Offensive

**Arkanoid: Global Offensive** is a modern reinterpretation of the classic Arkanoid, reimagined with a real-time multiplayer system, server-authoritative architecture, and physics-based competitive gameplay.
This project was developed as part of the *Object-Oriented Programming* course at the **University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Vietnam National University**.


## 🧩 Overview

Arkanoid: Global Offensive builds upon the spirit of the original Arkanoid while introducing a new layer of depth and competitiveness. It combines classic brick-breaking mechanics with arena-style multiplayer battles and a modular, scalable architecture.<br><br>
